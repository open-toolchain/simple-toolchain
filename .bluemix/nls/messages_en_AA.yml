template.description: "2:With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy a Cloud Foundry application. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, or you can link to your own GitHub repository. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_toolchain_flow)."
template.gettingStarted: "3:**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_toolchain_flow?task=2) for this toolchain."
